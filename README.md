# FlyJson
Swift Code to Json, and uploaded to jsonBin
Flyjson is built on top of SourceKitten, Vapor, and leaf 

with Flyjson you can write swift models in browser and get it converted to a Json file uploaded on an online free service 

so you write this: 
```swift

struct AppAdmin { 
var name = "Mostfa"
var age = 20
}
```

to get the following json 
```json
{
"name": "Mostfa",
"age": 20
}
```
